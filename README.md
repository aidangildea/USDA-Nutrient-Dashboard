# Nutrient Dashboard

The published dashboard can be found at [here](https://rpubs.com/aidangildea/nutrientdashboard). You can additionally read the policy report paired with this tool [here](https://rpubs.com/aidangildea/plantprotein).

In collaboration with researchers from Tufts University, Duke University and Penn State University, this interactive tool is part of the research project “From Scarcity to Prosperity: How Nutrition/Cost Tradeoffs Influence Consumer Choices and the Food System.” The data used in this dashboard are sourced from the 2013/2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the USDA/ERS Purchase-To-Plate Price Data Tool, and represents the consumption behaviors of women between 20-50 years old in the US. By harnessing insights from these interactive scatter plots, we can further understand the relationship between nutrient density and price, in turn, allowing us to achieve a more nutritional and affordable diet.
